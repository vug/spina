  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This is a self-assigned sample project for my application to DESRES. My goal is to show my enthusiasm about the topics on which DESRES is working, and also to provide a public code sample and a demostration page for the interviewers to analyze, and maybe even enjoy. :-)</p>
  <p>The project is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses#Invention_of_eyeglasses">Alessandro della Spina</a> of Pisa who was an Italian Friar from early 14th century and mass produced eyeglasses first. :-)</p>

  <h2>Components</h2>
  <p>Components of Spina are following</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simulator: A toy simulator written in Python that runs MD simulations of N atoms which only interact with Lennard-Jones potential.</li>
    <li>Visualizer. A browser based simulation results visualizer.</li>
    <li>Notebooks: Interactive Jupyter Notebooks to explain how the system works.</li>
  </ul>
